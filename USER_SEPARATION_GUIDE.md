# User-Based Resume Separation Guide

## Overview

ResumeRAG now implements **complete user-based data separation** to ensure privacy and proper access control for resumes uploaded by different users.

---

## 🔐 How It Works

### For Job Seekers (Candidates)

When a candidate logs in and uploads their resume:

1. **Upload Association**
   - Resume is tagged with `userId`, `uploaderName`, and `uploaderEmail`
   - Only the candidate who uploaded it can view/edit it

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - Candidates can ONLY see their own uploaded resumes
   - Other candidates' resumes are completely hidden
   - Total privacy for personal resume data

3. **Dashboard View**
   - Resume list shows only YOUR uploaded resumes
   - All features (ATS Helper, AI Summary) work only on your own resumes

### For Recruiters

When a recruiter logs in:

1. **Full Access**
   - Can see ALL resumes uploaded by all candidates
   - Each resume shows the candidate's name who uploaded it

2. **Candidate Information**
   - Resume displays: "Uploaded by: [Candidate Name]"
   - Recruiter can see candidate email associated with each resume
   - Can search and filter across all candidates

3. **Dashboard View**
   - Resume list shows ALL resumes from ALL candidates
   - All recruitment tools work across the entire resume database

## 📊 Data Model

### Resume Schema (Updated)

```javascript
{
  // User who uploaded this resume
  userId: String (required, indexed),
  uploaderName: String (required),
  uploaderEmail: String (required),
  
  // Resume details extracted from document
  filename: String,
  name: String,  // Name found in resume
  email: String,  // Email found in resume
  phone: String,
  skills: [String],
  education: [String],
  rawText: String,
  embedding: [Number],
  uploadedAt: Date
}
```

---

## 🔄 API Changes

### Upload Endpoint

**POST** `/api/resume/upload`

**Request:**
```javascript
FormData {
  resume: File,
  userId: String,
  userName: String,
  userEmail: String
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "resume_id",
    "summary": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@email.com",
      "skillCount": 15,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Resumes Endpoint

**GET** `/api/resume?userId={id}&userRole={role}&limit=20`

**Query Parameters:**
- `userId` - User ID (for filtering candidate's own resumes)
- `userRole` - "recruiter" or "candidate"
- `limit` - Number of results (default: 50)
- `skip` - Pagination offset (default: 0)

**Logic:**
```javascript
if (userRole === 'candidate') {
  // Return only resumes uploaded by this user
  query.userId = userId;
} else if (userRole === 'recruiter') {
  // Return ALL resumes (no filter)
}
```

## 💻 Frontend Implementation

### Upload Component

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

const SmartResumeParsing = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    const userInfo = {
      userId: user.id,
      userName: user.name,
      userEmail: user.email
    };
    
    await uploadResume(file, userInfo);
  };
};
```

### Fetch Resumes

```javascript
const loadResumes = async () => {
  const params = {
    limit: 20,
    userId: user.id,      // Current user's ID
    userRole: user.role   // 'recruiter' or 'candidate'
  };
  
  const response = await getAllResumes(params);
  // Candidates get only their resumes
  // Recruiters get all resumes
};
```

## 🎯 User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Candidate Uploads Resume

**User:** Jane (Candidate, ID: 123)

**Action:** Uploads resume `jane_resume.pdf`

**Database Entry:**
```json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "userId": "123",
  "uploaderName": "Jane Candidate",
  "uploaderEmail": "jane@email.com",
  "filename": "jane_resume.pdf",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  ...
}
```

**Jane's View:**
- Sees her resume in the list
- Can optimize, generate summary, etc.

**Other Candidates' View:**
- Cannot see Jane's resume at all

**Recruiter's View:**
- Sees Jane's resume
- Shows "Uploaded by: Jane Candidate"
- Can search and match against job descriptions

---

### Scenario 2: Multiple Candidates

**Database State:**
```
Resume 1: Uploaded by Alice (ID: 100)
Resume 2: Uploaded by Bob (ID: 101)  
Resume 3: Uploaded by Charlie (ID: 102)
Resume 4: Uploaded by Alice (ID: 100) [second resume]
```

**When Alice logs in (Candidate):**
- Sees Resume 1 and Resume 4 only
- Total: 2 resumes

**When Bob logs in (Candidate):**
- Sees Resume 2 only
- Total: 1 resume

**When Recruiter logs in:**
- Sees all 4 resumes
- Each shows uploader name
- Can search across all

- ✅ Resume data is isolated per user
- ✅ No data leakage between candidates

### Compliance
- ✅ GDPR-friendly (user data separation)
- ✅ Each user controls their own data
- ✅ Easy to implement user data deletion

### Access Control

## 🧪 Testing User Separation

### Test Case 1: Candidate Isolation

1. **Create Candidate 1:**
   - Signup as `alice@test.com`
   - Upload `alice_resume.pdf`

2. **Create Candidate 2:**
   - Logout
   - Signup as `bob@test.com`
   - Upload `bob_resume.pdf`

3. **Verify Isolation:**
   - Login as Alice → See only alice_resume.pdf
   - Login as Bob → See only bob_resume.pdf
   - ✅ Each candidate sees ONLY their own resume

### Test Case 2: Recruiter Access

1. **Create Recruiter:**
   - Login as recruiter
   - Go to any feature that lists resumes

2. **Verify Full Access:**
   - Should see BOTH alice_resume.pdf and bob_resume.pdf
   - Each resume shows uploader's name
   - ✅ Recruiter sees ALL resumes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Candidate sees other resumes

**Check:**
1. Is `userRole` being passed correctly?
2. Is `userId` from authenticated user?
3. Check backend filtering logic

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Ensure params are correct
const params = {
  userId: user.id,      // ← Must be from auth context
  userRole: user.role   // ← Must be 'candidate'
};
```

### Issue: Recruiter doesn't see all resumes

**Check:**
1. Is `userRole` set to 'recruiter'?
2. Backend should NOT filter when role is recruiter

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Backend logic
if (userRole === 'candidate' && userId) {
  query.userId = userId;  // Filter
}
// For recruiter, no filter applied
```
